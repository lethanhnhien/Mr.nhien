<p>If you are like me and born in the month of May, then you just might receive an emerald for your birthday. Or if you&#8217;re prepared to wait, it is also the gemstone marking 20 and 35 years of marriage. I just might have to wait for that!</p>
<p>When it comes to finding the emerald of your desire, how do you know what to look for or where to go? These are questions I get asked all the time by my girlfriends and you, my dear readers. So, let me share with you my expertise as a gemologist and walk you through everything you need to know about buying an emerald.</p>
<p>An Emerald As An Investment</p>
<p>The first decision you need to make before settling on the ideal emerald is whether or not you want an investment piece or if you are following your heart&#8217;s desire and looking for a design piece. One example I can give you is Elizabeth Taylor&#8217;s emerald and diamond pendant brooch that fetched $6,578,500 in 2011 – a record-breaking $280,000 per karat. There&#8217;s no doubt that this beautiful brooch is an investment piece, but it is also an exquisite design by Bulgari.</p>
